### Key Features

- **Seamless AI Assistant Integration**: Compatible with Cursor, VS Code, and Claude
- **Comprehensive Feature Flag Management**: Easily create, view, list, update, and delete feature flags
- **Environment-Specific Controls**: Toggle features on or off across different environments
- **Cursor Rule Setup**: Bootstrapping simplifies the configuration of Cursor rules to deliver contextual results and integrate with the SDK
-

This tool helps developers save time by managing feature flags right where they code, without switching between different tools.

### Required Configuration

To use the MCP server, you need to configure two mandatory environment variables:

- `VWO_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your VWO Account ID.
- `VWO_API_KEY`: Your VWO API Key (Developers Token) for interacting with RESTful APIs

These credentials are required to authenticate and connect with the VWO feature management system.

## How to Connect the MCP Server to Your Client

You can use the VWO MCP server with any client that supports the MCP protocol. Below are step-by-step guides for popular tools. Be sure to replace `VWO_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual VWO API key, and `VWO_API_KEY` with your VWO API URL.

### Cursor

1. Go to **Cursor Settings** and select the **MCP** section.
2. Click on **Add new global MCP server**.
3. When prompted, enter the following configuration (make sure to use your real credentials):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vwo-fme": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Save your changes. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a green status indicator showing the server is active.

---

### VS Code

1. Open your **User Settings (JSON)** in VS Code.
2. Add or update the MCP server configuration as shown below:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "vwo-fme": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the settings file. The MCP server should now be available in VS Code.

---

### Claude Desktop

1. Open the **Settings** menu and go to the **Developer** section.
2. Click **Edit Config** to open your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
3. Add the following block to your configuration (replace the placeholders with your actual credentials):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vwo-fme": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop. Once connected, you should see a hammer icon in the chat window, confirming the MCP server is active.

If you use a different client, refer to its documentation for how to add a custom MCP server. The configuration pattern will be similar to the examples above.

## Available Tools

Here's what you can do with our feature flag management tools:

### IDE Configuration with VWO

1. **Add VWO Rules** - Retrieve IDE rules and configuration settings to seamlessly manage feature flags within your project. This enables smooth integration with your SDK and leverages VWO's feature management capabilities.

üìù**Note**: Supports both Cursor IDE and VS Code. The tool automatically detects your IDE or you can specify it manually. Needs to be called once after setting up VWO FME MCP.

- **Cursor IDE**: Creates rules in `.cursor/rules/vwo-feature-flag-rule.mdc`
- **VS Code**: Creates instructions in `.github/instructions/vwo-fme.instructions.md`

### Feature Flags

1. **Create Feature Flag With Defaults** - Create a complete feature flag with variables, variations, associated metric, rules, and automatic enablement. This tool handles the entire setup process.

2. **Create Feature Flag** - Create a new feature flag into your VWO account with mandatory requirements like variables, variations and metrics.

3. **Delete Feature Flag** - Safely remove any feature flag from your account when it's no longer needed.

4. **Get Feature Flag** - Dive into the details of any feature flag to see its current configuration and status.

5. **List Feature Flags** - Get a bird's-eye view of all your feature flags in one place.

6. **Update Feature Flag** - Fine-tune your feature flags by modifying their properties, metrics, and variations.

7. **Toggle Feature Flag** - Instantly enable or disable feature flags in different environments with a single click.

8. **Find Stale Feature Flags** - Identify unused or stale feature flags in your codebase by scanning your source code and comparing against active feature flags. This helps maintain clean code by finding feature flags that are no longer referenced in your project.

9. **Integrate SDK** - Get comprehensive SDK integration documentation and code examples for seamless feature flag implementation in your project. This tool provides language-specific integration guides without requiring Cursor rule files.

### Feature Flag Rules

1. **List Feature Flag Rules** - View all rules associated with your feature flags.

2. **Create Rollout and Personalize Rule** - Set up rules for gradual rollout or personalization of your features.

3. **Create Testing and MVT Rule** - Configure rules for A/B testing or multivariate testing.

4. **Get Feature Flag Rule** - Examine the details of a specific feature flag rule.

5. **Toggle Feature Flag Rule** - Enable or disable specific rules for your feature flags.

6. **Update Feature Flag Rules** - Modify existing feature flag rules to change their configuration or targeting.

7. **Delete Feature Flag Rule** - Remove unwanted rules from your feature flags.

### Projects and Environments

1. **List Projects and Environments** - See all your projects and their associated environments.

### Metrics

1. **Get Metrics** - Access metrics for your feature flags and experiments.

## Requirements

- **Node.js v12 or later**
