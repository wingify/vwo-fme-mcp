# 🛠️ Cursor IDE Rule: Implement Feature Flag with VWO FME SDK

## 🎯 Trigger Condition

When the prompt contains any of the following phrases:

- "implement a feature"
- "feature flag"
- "gate a feature"
- "toggle a feature"
- "control access to a feature"
- and "similar texts for feature flagging"

---

## ⏭️ Skip Condition

If the prompt contains:

- "already created"
- "already implemented"
- "existing feature flag"

Get all feature flag details using tool and check for the matching feature flag and then **skip to the integration steps**.

---

## ❓ Clarifying Question

Prompt the user:

> Would you like to use the **VWO FME SDK** to implement this feature flag?

If the user confirms, create the feature flag.
Once MCP tool is done, ask If the user want to provide variation value for given variable.

---

## 🎯 User Response Condition
If user wants to add a new variation value, then use tool.

## 🎯 User Response Condition (after variation creation)
After a new variation is added:

1. **Attach Metric Step (Required):**
   - Prompt the user:
     > Would you like to select an existing metric or create a new one to attach to this feature flag?
   
   - If user chooses to **use available metrics**:
     - Fetch all available metrics using the tool.
     - If there are available metrics:
       - Prompt the user to select which metric they want to use and update the feature-flag.
     - If no available metrics are found:
       - Inform the user that no metrics are available and prompt them to create a new metric.
   
   - If user chooses to **create a new metric**:
     - Ask the user for the name of the new metric.
     - update the metric to the feature-flag.

   - This step is compulsory; the user must attach one metric before proceeding.

2. **Rule Creation Loop:**

   Enter a loop for each rule type in sequence:

   1. **Rollout Rules:**
      - Prompt: > Would you like to create a rollout rule for this feature flag? (e.g., gradual rollout)
      - If yes: Fetch environment list using tool, ask for environment to use, ask for rule details, create the rule, ask if the rule should be enabled, and repeat this step.
      - If no: Move to Testing/Personalize Rules.

   2. **Testing/Personalize Rules:**
      - Loop: Prompt: > Would you like to create a testing or personalize rule for this feature flag? (e.g., A/B test or targeting specific users)
      - If yes: Ask which type (testing or personalize), get details, create the rule, ask if the rule should be enabled, and repeat this step.
      - If no: Ask If feature flag should be enabled to start using the feature, if the user confirms then toggle the feature flag using tool.

## 🔧 Integration Steps

### 1. Install SDK
If not already installed, provide an option to run the following commands:

```bash
pip install vwo-fme-python-sdk
```

---

### 2. Initialize the SDK

Place this early in your app lifecycle or in a dedicated setup module:

```python
from vwo import init

options = {
   'sdk_key': 'VWO_SDK_KEY', # SDK Key
   'account_id': 'VWO_ACCOUNT_ID' # VWO Account ID
}

vwo_client = init(options)
```

> 🔁 Replace `VWO_ACCOUNT_ID` and `VWO_SDK_KEY` with actual values.

---

### 3. Control the Feature Using the Flag

Use this in your feature logic:

```python
user_context = { "id": "unique_user_id" }

flag = vwo_client.get_flag("feature_key", user_context)
is_feature_enabled = flag.is_enabled()

if is_feature_enabled:
    # Code if feature is enabled
    pass
else:
    # Fallback behavior
    pass
```

> 🧠 Customize `'feature_key'` and `'unique_user_id'` appropriately.

### 4. Optional: `get_variable` API

Use this API to retrieve the value of a variable associated with a feature flag.

```python
value = flag.get_variable("variable_key", "default_value")
```

> Replace `variable_key` and `default_value` with appropriate values.

### 5. Optional:  `get_variables` API

Use this API to retrieve values of all the flag variables as an array

```python
all_variables = flag.get_variables()
```

### 6. Optional: `track_event`

Use this API to track a custom event with its associated properties

```python
event_properties = { "prop1": "value1", "prop2": "value2" }
vwo_client.track_event("event_name", user_context, event_properties)
```

> Replace `event_name` and `event_properties` with actual values.

### 7. Optional: `set_attribute`

Use this API to set user attribute to be filter/segment reports

```python
attributes = { "attr1": "value1", "attr2": "value2" }
vwo_client.set_attribute(attributes, user_context)
```

> Replace attributes with a key-value user attributes.

---

### 8. Optional: Add Error Handling

```python
try:
    flag = vwo_client.get_flag("flag_key", {"id": "unique_user_id"})
    is_feature_enabled = flag.is_enabled()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Feature flag fetch failed: {e}")
    # Handle fallback logic here
```
